A simple POC showing [League of Legends](https://developer.riotgames.com/docs/lol) champions to see how these libraries work together.

- NX as repo manager;
- NestJS with GraphQL as API;
- React as UI;
- React with Tailwind as Design System library;
- SWR with URQL as API client;
- MSW as mock server.

## Getting started
