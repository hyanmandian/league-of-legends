# League of Legends

A simple POC showing [League of Legends](https://developer.riotgames.com/docs/lol) champions to see how these libraries work together.

- NX as repo manager;
- NestJS with GraphQL as API;
- React as UI;
- React as Design System library with Tailwind (via twin.macro) and Goober;
- SWR with URQL as API client;
- MSW as mock server.

## Getting started

- Install dependencies with `npm install`;
- Run the API with `npm start api` or UI with `npm start ui`.
