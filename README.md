# League of Legends

A simple POC showing [League of Legends](https://developer.riotgames.com/docs/lol) champions to see how these libraries work together.

- NX as repo manager;
- NestJS with GraphQL as API;
- React as UI with NextJS (preact);
- React as Design System library with Tailwind (via twind);
- SWR with URQL as API client;
- MSW as mock server.

## Getting started

- Install dependencies with `npm install`;
- Run the API with `npm start server`, UI with `npm start web` or the Design System with `npm run storybook`.
